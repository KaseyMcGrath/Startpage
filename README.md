# Startpage

A simple custom startpage built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
I made this project to practice front-end development and to create a personal landing page for my browser.

## Features
- Clean layout
- Responsive design (works on different screen sizes)
- Retro aesthetic

## Screenshot
*(Add an image later if you want â€” e.g., `![screenshot](screenshot.png)`)*

## Getting Started
To try it out:
1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KaseyMcGrath/Startpage.git
 
2. Open index.html in your browser, you can save it as your home page within your browser settings.
